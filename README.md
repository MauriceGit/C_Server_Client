# Simple implementation of a server and client in C

There is a very simple protocol for some actions over the (not secured) network.
It allows to either forward commands to the servers os or to get responses from commands executed on the server's system.

I wrote and mainly used the server to backdoor friends computers at university.

Resulting in very funny situations where programs just opened, closed or some unexpected behaviour.
But was never used to harm anyone or deliberately damage hard or software in any form.
